      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a student in a web development course.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Woods Cross, Utah, in a family of seven children. I have three sisters and three brothers, and I am the penultimate child. We stayed in the same house all my childhood, and my parents still live there. After graduating from high school, I moved to Provo, Utah and completed my bachelor's degree in psychology.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to rock climbing and being outside. My dad took me river rafting as a young kid and I've loved it ever since! In the last year, I've been getting into dog training, and my dog and I are currently working on getting her "Canine Good Citizen" award. 
        <br> Indoors, I enjoy digital design and making short videos. I also love playing the piano and song-writing.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>If I could choose anything, I would choose a circus performer. Unfortunately, I don't have any circus experience or talent, so that won't happen. I do, however, enjoy developing websites, so I look forward to a career in full stack development</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Centerville, Utah with my fiance and our dog. It's only a few miles away from where I grew up.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love problem solving and creating something new. Three of my siblings are in the tech field, and they introduced me to the field. I've been developing websites for only a short time, but I love it already.</p>
